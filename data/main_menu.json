Yet, we are proud to say that five years after the initial release of this game, SkyBlock is still thriving! With the next five years, we aim to accomplish even greater things within Minecraft, but for now, we'd like to extend a special thank you to our players, the people who have kept this game alive for so long. Without you, Hypixel SkyBlock would just be a series of bad ideas in Jayavarmen's head.",
